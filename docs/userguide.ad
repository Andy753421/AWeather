About and contact information
-----------------------------
AWeather was created in the summer of 2008 and functions as a NEXRAD Level II
radar display program. The goal of this application is to fulfill a need through
providing ample weather information without excessive cost and size that is not
limited to the Linux operating system.

It is written in a standard GTK+/GObject architecture and features an
interactive display utilizing Grits and OpenGL technologies.

The software source code is available for download on the RHLUG server at
git://lug.rose-hulman.edu/proj/aweather.

AWeather relies upon the following dependencies: http://www.gtk.org/[gtk+] 2.16
or later, http://www.gnome.org/[libsoup] 2.26 or later, http://bzip.org/[bzip],
http://trmm-fc.gsfc.nasa.gov/trmm_gv/software/rsl[rsl] 1.42 or later, and
others.

Packaged versions of the software are currently available for Gentoo, Debian,
Ubuntu, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OSX operating systems.

The program currently provides data viewing from the standard one dimensional
plan view to user-defined three-dimensional dynamic views of current and recent
radar data.

The software was developed and is maintained by Andy Spencer. He may be
contacted through e-mail at andy753421@gmail.com and chat through IRC at #rhlug
on irc.freenode.net.

AWeather is provided as free software according to the terms of the GNU General
Public License (version 3 or later) as published by the Free Software Foundation

Data types and sources
----------------------
AWeather displays U.S. National Weather Service NEXt generation RADar data
(NEXRAD) Level II data.  This is the highest resolution form of radar data
available in the public domain and consists of multiple tilts of data updated
every 5 to 10 minutes depending on the current scan mode of each radar.

The following Level II data types are supported by this program:

- Base reflectivity (power return of current precipitation intensity)

- Base velocity (Doppler-derived speed and direction of radar returns)

- Spectrum width (The variation of velocity detected within each radar pixel or
  bin)

- Differential Reflectivity (The ratio of the reflected horizontal and vertical
  power returns) footnoteref:[dualpol]

- Differential Phase (A comparison of the phase difference between the
  horizontal and vertical returns) footnoteref:[dualpol]

- Correlation Coefficient (A statistical correlation between the reflected
  horizontal and vertical power returns) footnoteref:[dualpol,Only available at
  WSR-88D sites that have been upgraded to support dual-polarization]

Level II data has been available through private weather data vendors for some
time but recently has been generously provided by some universities.

AWeather requires an active internet connection along with a data feed source in
order to retrieve, decode and display current or recent radar data.

The default radar feed is publically accessible thanks to Iowa State University
and is located at: http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/data/nexrd2/raw/.

AWeather also displays some severe weather alerts provided by the NOAA weather
alerts http://alerts.weather.gov/[feed].


Program layout
--------------
AWeather consists of a graphical user interface window that contains a file menu
bar, a button bar, a date and time side bar, a large map and data viewing pane
and a bottom data status bar.


The file menu commands

              with the map and data viewing pane when the mouse is moved to the
              edge of the screen

Radar

The radar menu contains list of all the support NEXRAD radar sites sorted by
state. Selecting a site will zoom AWeather to that location.

Help
~~~~
[horizontal]
User Guide::  displays this documentation of program operation and features
Man Page::    displays a HTML version of the UNIX man page
About::       contains current program version, copyright, development site,
              credits and licensing information


The button bar
--------------
The program button bar contains 6 options:

[horizontal]
Magnifying glass with plus sign::   decreases the viewing area
Magnifying glass with minus sign::  increases the viewing area
Window icon with expanding arrows:: Toggles between fullscreen and normal viewing modes
Plug button::                       toggles between offline and online program mode
Circular arrow button::             reloads the current display
Wrench and screwdriver button::     Opens the preferences window


The date and time side bar
--------------------------
The date and time side bar resides on the right side of the program window, it contains:

* The date button, which reveals a calendar of the current month when clicked

* The time button, which reveals a list of each hour when clicked

** Clicking on an hour will reveal a list of times in 5 minute intervals that
   the user can select to load radar data from footnote:[Radar data can only be
   loaded if it has been previously cached or is from a recent enough date and
   can still be obtained from the NEXRAD server]


The map and data viewing pane
-----------------------------
On program startup and when zoomed far from the earth's surface AWeather
displays a national radar composite image.

As the user zooms closer to the earth AWeather will automatically activate
nearby radar sites.

The radar data will be plotted on the map while the scan and product information
will be displayed at the bottom of the program.

All active radar sites will show as tabs while site's available tilt and product
data will display to the right of the tab.

Simply click on a button to display that product/tilt in the map window.

An isosurface slider is shown below the product/tilt buttons.  Slide the
selector to reveal the rendered isosurface structure of reflectivity data.

A color scale will automatically appear at the top left corner of the map window
corresponding to each available product.


Viewing severe  weather alerts
------------------------------
When the alert plugin is enabled, AWeather will automatically shade each county
that is under a weather alert in a color corresponding to the type of alert.

For storm based warnings, AWeather will also draw a polygon representing the
warning area.

Individual alert types can be enabled and disabled by clicking on the toggle
button in the alert tab at the bottom of the screen.

To view more information about a particular alert, click on one the shaded
county or inside the polygon warning area in the viewing pane. This will bring
up the alert details dialog with a tab for each alert that is active for the
location that was clicked.

The alert dialog displays the alert title and valid time along with the text
descriptions provided by the weather service. Clicking the "Full Text" button
will open the full text of the alert in a web browser.

AWeather supports the use of the mouse and keyboard commands to change the map
window settings.
